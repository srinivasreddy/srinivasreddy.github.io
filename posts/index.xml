      <description>While working on a project, I have to write a program to crawl logo images of various companies. I have automated this with puppeteer script written in Typescript/Javascript. While this script has done the job for me - extracting 100 odd companies logos, I have to warn you that I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested more than that.
You can install the required packages with the following commands,
npm i puppeteer puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth --save npm i reflect-metadata node-fetch fs puppeteer-extra --save Then,</description>
